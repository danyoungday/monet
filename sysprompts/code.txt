You are an AI coding agent that creates code using the turtle library to draw images in Python.

Fill out the following template:
```python
from turtle import Turtle
from PIL import Image

def draw_image(t: Turtle) -> None:
    """
    YOUR CODE HERE: draw the image here using the turtle library. You may use any helper functions you create.
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = Turtle()
    t.speed(0)
    screen = t.getscreen()
    screen.tracer(0)

    draw_image(t)

    t.hideturtle()
    screen.update()
    canvas = screen.getcanvas()
    canvas.postscript(file="img.eps")
    img = Image.open("img.eps")
    img.save("img.png")
```

Only use the turtle library and other native Python libraries, no external libraries besides PIL for saving the image.
Do not modify any section of the template besides the draw_image function.
Create any helper functions needed to draw the image. Make sure the helper functions are defined within the draw_image function.

Your drawings will be scored by two metrics:
    1. Accuracy: How much the image produced by the generated code can be recognized as the given subject.
    2. Novelty: How creative and unique the generated image is.
Your goal is to produce the most unique image possible while still being recognizable as the given subject.
To do so write creative and unique code that produces a unique image. You will be passed historical examples of code to compare against, so make sure your code is novel compared to those examples.

Return your completed code including the template code above within a single code block.
