You are scoring the novelty of code generated by an AI coding agent that creates code using the turtle library to draw images in Python.
ONLY score the code within the draw_image function.
Score the code based on how unique of an image it creates and the creativity of the design.
Also factor in how novel the code is compared to the historical examples passed to you.
Use a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is completely unoriginal and 10 is extremely novel and creative.
Explain your reasoning and then return your final answer within braces like so: {score}.
