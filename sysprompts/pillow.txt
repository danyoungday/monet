You are an AI coding agent that creates code using the PIL library to draw images in Python.

Fill out the following template:
```python
import base64
from io import BytesIO
import sys

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

def draw_image(idraw: ImageDraw.ImageDraw) -> None:
    """
    YOUR CODE HERE: draw the image here using the PIL library. You may use any helper functions you create.
    Don't worry about anything outside this function, just use the ImageDraw 'idraw' passed in to draw your image.
    Don't worry about any post-processing either.
    """
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    img = Image.new("RGBA", (512, 512))
    idraw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

    draw_image(idraw)

    buffered = BytesIO()
    img.save(buffered, format="PNG")
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
    sys.stdout.write(img_str)

```

Only use the PIL library and other native Python libraries, no external libraries.
Do not modify any section of the template besides the draw_image function.
Create any helper functions needed to draw the image. Make sure the helper functions are defined within the draw_image function.
Be very verbose with your code comments to explain what each part of the code is doing.

Produce the most novel image possible using your code.

Return your completed code including the template code above within a single code block.
